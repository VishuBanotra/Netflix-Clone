# Netflix Clone Project

Welcome to my Netflix Clone project repository! This project was my learning journey in which I created a Netflix clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I integrated the TMDB API to fetch movie and TV show data and replicate the look and feel of the Netflix interface.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TMDB API

## Key Features

- Displaying a list of popular movies and TV shows fetched from the TMDB API.
- Replicating the Netflix user interface with a scrolling row of movie posters.
- Implementing responsive design for optimal viewing across different devices.
- Creating interactive elements using JavaScript for a dynamic user experience.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into:

- HTML and CSS structure to create visually appealing layouts.
- Utilizing JavaScript to fetch data from APIs and dynamically update the user interface.
- Handling and displaying complex data, such as movie posters and details, from the TMDB API.


Happy coding!
